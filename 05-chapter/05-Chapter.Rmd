## ACT score at a certain college

A student wants to know the average ACT score at her college (the ACT is a standardized collegereadiness
exam taken by many U.S. students). She surveys 9 students and get the following data:

Student | ACT
--------|--------
1 | 26
2 | 34
3 | 21
4 | 26
5 | 23
6 | 24
7 | 15
8 | 18
9 | 21

### Given 𝜎: Calculate MoE and 95% CI

Nationally, for ACT scores, σ = 5. Using this knowledge, calculate MoE and the 95% CI for
this sample to estimate the average ACT score at this college.

We are assuming that the data are normally distributed. We know that n = 9 and σ = 5. 
We are going to use the R function `qnorm` for the normal distribution. 

```{r sigma-given}

n = 9   # number of data records manuall or with r: "n = length(<variableName>)"
s = 5   # sigma (given)
CI = .95 # confidence intervall

## 1. First of all we need to get the data into a variable:
ACT <- c(26,34,21,26,23,24,15,18,21)

## 2. Now we can calculate the mean M
M <- mean(ACT)
M

## 3. CI = 95% for both sides. One side:
a <- 1 - (1-CI)/2

## 4. calculate margin of error (MoE) when 𝜎 is given:
MoE <- qnorm(a) * (s/sqrt(n))
MoE

## 5. calculate the CI extensions: The 95% CI extends MoE either side of M, so it is [M – MoE, M + MoE].
left  <- M - MoE
right <- M + MoE
left
right

```

Our level of certainty about the true mean is 95% in predicting that the true mean is within the interval between `r round(left,1)` and `r round(right,1)` assuming that the original random variable is normally distributed, and the sample data are independent.

Using σ = 5 we obtain: M = `r round(M,1)`, 95% CI [`r round(left,1)`, `r round(right,1)`], MoE = `r round(MoE,1)`.
